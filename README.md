# WW4_mini_places

These are the WW4 models for scene classification.

.caffemodel and .solverstate files were too large to include on dropbox. 

The Deep WW4-VGG-A and Deep WW4-VGG-B models are the same, they were simply trained differently from scratch and have different .caffemodel and .solverstate files. 

Please contact for the files.
